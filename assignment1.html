<h2>describing his idea</h2>
<p2>Seneca saw death as a process-it is happening to us right now.<br/>We are dying every day, he said. Even as you read this post, time is passing that you will never get back. That time, he said, belongs to death. <br/>

 <h3>About Death</h3>
<p3>Death doesn't lie off in the distance. It's with us right now. It's the second hand on the clock. It's the setting sun.</p3>
